# Components in K8S

## POD
A Kubernetes pod is a collection of one or more LinuxÂ® containers, and is the smallest unit of a Kubernetes application. Any given pod can be composed of multiple, tightly coupled containers (an advanced use case) or just a single container (a more common use case).

## Replicaset
A ReplicaSet (RS) is a Kubernetes object used to maintain a stable set of replicated pods running within a cluster at any given time.

A ReplicaSet is responsible for ensuring that the number of running PODs is as specified.
